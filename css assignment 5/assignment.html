                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Lack of interaction</b>: Online learning can be isolating, as it lacks the face-to-face interaction that traditional classroom-based learning provides.</p>

                            <li>

                                <p><b>Self-discipline</b>: Online learning requires self-discipline and motivation, as students need to manage their own schedules and stay on track with their studies.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p><b>Limited feedback</b>: Online learning may provide limited feedback from instructors, which can make it difficult for students to know if they are on the right track or need to improve.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><b>Cheating</b>: Online learning can increase the risk of cheating, as students may be tempted to plagiarize or use unauthorized resources during exams or assignments.</p>
